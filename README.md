# :page_with_curl: Portfolio

My portfolio made with Flutter and Firebase.

## :dart: Goals

The main goal of this project was to create a place where I could easily manage my personal and professional information and at the same time being able to convert it into a .pdf file that I could then forward to IT Recruiters or simply share my portfolio application url.

## :wrench: Tools

To do this whole app I've recurred to a few tools and frameworks.

* :computer::iphone::watch: Flutter and Dart
  * I've used [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/) because I've decided to learn more about Flutter's framework since it has the ability  to create multiplaform applications and I've been looking forward to this for the longest time because I don't like to feel limited to which platform I'm programming to.

* :fire: Firebase
  * I've also used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) due to the non-SQL database format that I actually love (similar to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Collection / Document structure) and due to the amount of available resources ([Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth), [Firestore Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore), [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting), etc.) and compability since both Flutter and Firebase belong to Google.
